    <h2>Undergraduate Dissertation</h2>
    <h3><b><i>Schrödinger's Real-Valued Fourth-Order Equation and the Complex Nature of Quantum Wave Functions</i></b></h3>
    <h5>Supervisor: Dr. Kolahal Bhattacharya,<br>
        Assitant professor, Physics<br>
        St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata</h5>
    <p>Schrodinger first presents a fourth order in space, second order in time real-valued wave-equation to obtain the 
        wave function that produces the correct quadratic dispersion relation for matter waves. Later he discards this
        real equation and introduces the second-order complex-valued differential equation. In this paper, the real-valued
        Schrodinger equation has been extensively studied and solved analytically, and a comparison has been drawn
        between its applicability with the second-order equation.</p><br><br>
    <h2>Summer Schools</h2>
    <h3><b><i>Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 : The Path to Utility</i></b></h3>
    <h5>IBM Quantum</h5>
    <p>The event centered on helping participants master the many new capabilities introduced with the recent release of the <i>Qiskit SDK’s</i> first major version, and on teaching participants everything they need to scale their experiments to large quantum processors.<br>
    The intensive, two-week-long program started by giving students a thorough overview of foundational quantum computing topics — with this year’s curriculum emphasizing quantum software as opposed to quantum hardware.<br>
    Week 1 lectures provided students a detailed overview of <i>Qiskit SDK</i> v1.x, while the week 2 curriculum consisted of deep dives into three application areas. Along the way, four labs on topics like quantum circuit transpilation, noise-model building, and more were there to challenge the participants and thereby enhancing their problem solving approach. The event concluded, as is tradition, with a panel discussion in which a group of IBM experts fielded questions on any and all quantum-related topics.</p><br><br>
    <h2>Summer Courses</h2>
    <h3><b><i>Quantum Information, Quantum Field Theory and Gravity</i></b></h3>
    <h5>ICTS, TIFR<br>
    Bengalore</h5>
    <p>This program seeks to bring together leading experts working at the intersection of quantum gravity, quantum information theory and many-body physics in the hope of ushering in a new wave of progress in this multidisciplinary field.<br><br> The program will focus on the following broad themes:
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum error correction, the emergence of spacetime, and the black hole interior</li>
            <li>Complexity growth and saturation and its manifestation in gravity</li>
            <li>Multiparty entanglement and its role in holography</li>
            <li>The importance of gravitational constraints in the localization of quantum information</li>
            <li>Tensor network models in condensed matter and quantum gravity</li>
        </ul>
